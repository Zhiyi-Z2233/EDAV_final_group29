Specifically, we will explore various aspects of the restaurant industry, including sales, profitability, safety standards, and customer satisfaction levels.\nTo achieve this, we have acquired a large data set detailing the inspection of over 250,000 restaurants in NYC. We will leverage R for data analysis and visualization, utilizing relevant packages to uncover trends and patterns. Through this analysis, we hope to gain meaningful insights into the factors that drive success and challenges within New York’s vibrant restaurant scene.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Restaurant Inspection Data\nWe utilize the DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection dataset from the NYC OpenData library. This dataset includes details on all sustained or pending violation citations from full or special program inspections conducted within three years prior to the most recent inspection. The data covers restaurants and college cafeterias that are actively operating as of the RECORD DATE (the date the data was pulled).\nKey points about this dataset: - This is a huge data set containing about 260,000 observations of 27 variables. The data is updated daily according to the description of the data.\n\nEach violation record is associated with an inspection, and establishments with multiple violations will have repeated fields for each violation.\nEstablishments are uniquely identified by their CAMIS (record ID) number.\nRestaurants that have started operations or gone out of business within the dataset period are included only if they were active on the RECORD DATE.\nRecords also include restaurants applying for permits but not yet inspected and inspections resulting in no violations.\nRestaurants with an inspection date of “1/1/1900” are new establishments awaiting inspection.\nRestaurants with no violations are represented by a single row coded as having no violations in the ACTION field.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Fast Food Chain Analysis Data\nFor the analysis of the most popular fast food chains, we use a dataset that provides nationwide data for the United States, not limited to New York. This dataset is sourced from Passby Blog’s Top Fast Food Chains Foot Traffic, offering insights into consumer behavior and fast food chain popularity across the country. We build this dataset manually.\n\n\n2.1.3 Customer Satisfaction Data\nTo explore customer satisfaction, we use data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). This dataset evaluates customer satisfaction levels across various restaurant types and food delivery services, providing valuable insights into consumer preferences and trends.\nWe build this dataset manually.",

Grade, Grade Date, and Location Point1 have the most missing values, especially Location Point1 which is literally an empty column. This might be because it is left for use to incorporate with interactive maps. For the purpose of this project we can safely remove this column. More than half of the restaurants in this data are missing their Grade and Grade Date data. This might be because the Grade, which depends on adjudication results, has not been issued to the establishment (the restaurants).\nIn addition, since this dataset is compiled from several large administrative data systems, it contains some illogical values that could be a result of data entry or transfer errors, which would also lead to data missing. However, with more than 260,000 restaurants on the list, we think this percentage of missing values is acceptable.",

Let’s then take a look at how the grade distribution is like for each borough.\nCode\n#ggplot(percent_data, aes(x = BORO, y = percentage, fill = GRADE)) +\n # geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  #labs(\n   #  title = \"Percentage of Grades across Boroughs\",\n    #x = \"Boroughs\",\n    #y = \"Percentage\"\n# ) +\n # theme_minimal() +\n  #scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\nCode\nrestaurant_clean |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = GRADE, fill= GRADE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~BORO) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Grades\",\n    x = \"Grade\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"N\",\"Z\",\"P\"))\nWe can see that Manhattan, with the highest number of Grade A restaurants, is very diligent with keeping the hygiene level, at least in terms of food. Although it also has more Grade B’s and C’s, but the total number of restaurants from Manhattan is also the highest so we need to take this into account and study the percentage of the grade distribution for each borough.\nCode\npercent_data &lt;- restaurant_clean %&gt;%\n  count(BORO, GRADE) %&gt;%\n  group_by(BORO) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\npercent_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = BORO, y = n, fill= GRADE)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), \"%\")), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of restaurants across boroughs\",\n    x = \"Boroughs\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\nIndeed, Manhattan as the busiest borough rank the top in terms of number restaurants, and Brooklyn and Queens come next. Surprisingly, with the lowest number of restaurants, Staten Island actually has the highest percentage of Grade A restaurants. Although the size of the Staten Island borough is almost the same as Brooklyn, but it is way less crowded with better management.\nOn the other hand, Bronx, also with a smaller number of restaurants, doesn’t do as well according to its relatively low percentage of Grade A restaurants. It also has the highest percentage of Grade B restaurants, implying that the hygiene level of the borough is not as well managed as the other ones.",

    "text": "There are so many ways we can play with the abundant data on restaurants! Through insightful exploratory data analysis and visualizations over the three data sets, we gained a deeper understanding of the thriving cuisine culture in New York City. From the Grade Distribution we learned that most of the restaurants maintain a good safety standard. The management of the restaurants community also gives us a glimpse on the living standards in different boroughs. In future research we could find life quality data across boroughs and connect it with the restaurants data to confirm the correlation.\nFrom Favorite Cuisine Type, we can see that NYC offers abundant choices of food. We also notice that some boroughs do better in a certain type of cuisine, such as Latin American food in Queens. These Cuisine type data analysis also gives implications on formation pattern of different cultural communities in NYC. Forming such a correlation could be a future topic.\nLastly, we confirmed the significant popularity of Starbucks among American people’s heart. Although having fewer number of locations than Subway, it makes the highest revenue with a decent customer satisfaction level (Chick-fil-a ranks the highest…). Unfortunately we didn’t get too much of a time elapse data on this one which could be a part of future exploration.\nAlthough with limitations on the organization and format of the presentation, we gained valuable experience with remote collaboration on GitHub and trying out an interactive way of presenting the data. We also learned a lot about how helpful ChatGPT can be with code writing an improving efficiency. We will continue to incorporate technology into our future research.\nThank you for reviewing our final project!\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(magick)\nimg &lt;- magick::image_read(\"~/Desktop/Columbia/EDAV/EDAV Final Project/image.png\")\nplot(img)",
